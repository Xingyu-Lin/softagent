1. write a controller.
    - how is action used in the model?
        current particle/shape velocity/pos ----action-on-shape---> next shape velocity/pos -> prepare input -> forward model 
        -> next particle/shape vel/pos -> compare particle pos to give loss.

        key is to make prepare input differentiable. 
        There is also some preparation work in the forward model, need to make that differentiable either. 

2. design the model structure and generate training data for sphere controlled cloth flattening.
